//! Client for the ZeroClaw daemon RPC.
//!
//! The daemon serves NDJSON JSON-RPC 2.0 over a local socket, a Windows
//! named pipe, or (inside the daemon process) an in-memory duplex. This
//! crate is the client half of that contract: it dials, runs the
//! `initialize` handshake, multiplexes requests and their responses,
//! delivers notifications and server-initiated requests, and knows how to
//! back off between reconnect attempts. It depends on the wire contract in
//! `zeroclaw-rpc-proto` and the envelope types in `zeroclaw-api`, and on
//! nothing from the runtime.
//!
//! [`RpcClient::connect_over`] accepts any byte stream, so the same client
//! serves the gateway's in-process seam today and the separate gateway
//! process later; [`RpcClient::connect_local`] dials the daemon endpoint
//! that [`endpoint::resolve_socket_path`] names.
